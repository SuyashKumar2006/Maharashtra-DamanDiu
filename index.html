                <p class="intro">Daman and Diu was a union territory in western India. With an area of 112 km2, it was
                    the
                    smallest federal division of India on the mainland. The territory comprised two distinct regions
                    Daman
                    and Diu that are geographically separated by the Gulf of Khambhat. The state of Gujarat and the
                    Arabian
                    Sea bordered the territory. A Portuguese colony since the 1500s, the territories were annexed by
                    India
                    in 1961. Daman and Diu were administered as part of the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu
                    between
                    1961 and 1987, when they became a separate union territory. In 2019, legislation was passed to merge
                    the
                    union territory of Daman and Diu with its neighbouring union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, to
                    form
                    the new union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu with effect from 26 January
                    2020.
